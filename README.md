# Development of a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for OpenFOAM
The GUI is at a operational stage (a very simple one), but it is far to be completed. As OpenFOAM is forever expanding, 
the GUI also has the capability of incorporating new modules and adding new functionalities. 
The advantage is that since the Program structure is modular one could assume that there will not be difficulties in adding more models, 
solvers and functionalities (heat transfer, rheology or multiphase flow problems), not only it can be expanded but it can be improved in so many ways, 
beginning with the mesh generation module (snappyHexMesh, which set a lot of parameters to be default and not user defined. 
Progress bars for long time running processes could be added, an embedded mesh previewer and help contextual text/tips could be of great profit for the user.

I hope that this encourage many other to collaborate and to develop new project within the open-source community.

Requirements: OpenFoam installed in Linux OS
